    "1) **Working with heuristics**: let's say I have a heuristic that tries to find a better solution by changing part of the solution. How can I check whether this heuristic, that does not use the solver, has found a better solution? Ther eis no way to simply evaluate the objective function and check. It is equally not possible to simply check whether the constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Testing**: To check whether a constraint behaves as we expect it to (terms added as they should etc.), it is necessary to evaluate a term. Not having this option makes the tests weaker and doesn't even allow you to run certain tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Interaction with user interface**: When developing optimization tools, I like to give the user a sense of the optimizer. Now let's say the user makes a manual change to a solution (e.g. it is a decision support system). When there is no \"evaluate\" possibility, then how can I give feedback to the user whether his/her change resulted in a better solution from the optimizers point of view?\n",
